<summary>add the html elements to set the structure of the application</summary>

#### 1.1 description
welcome to the starting line of your coding race! in this first stage of "simple stopwatch," imagine you're crafting a sleek stopwatch app tailored for runners gearing up for their big race day. your first task is to create the essential html elements that will pave the way for a seamless timing experience.

picture this: the runners are lacing up their shoes, heartbeats quickening with anticipation. as the race director, your html toolkit must include:

title (h1): a bold and inspiring header that sets the pace for the challenge ahead. the text should be "simple stopwatch".

timer (p): the beating heart of your stopwatch, ready to track every second of the race. the starting text should be "00:00:00".

start, stop, reset, lap buttons: the control center for our runners, offering the power to kick off, pause, restart, and mark key moments in their journey.

with these elements in place, you're not just building a stopwatchâ€”you're creating a tool that will help runners push their limits and achieve their personal best. get ready to code your way to the finish line! on your mark, get set, code!
